  This chart shows the team's progress and remaining workload during Sprint 1. Although progress was slow in the first days, the pace increased in the following days, and all work was successfully completed by the end of the sprint.

 - Actual Remaining Work: Shows the amount of work remaining for the team at the end of each day.
 - Ideal Progress: Shows what the reduction would be if an equal amount of work were completed each day.

  - **Sprint Review:**
    - Miro was installed for the project and the team task board was created.
    - We prepared the project file and made updates to it.
    - We had difficulty deciding on an application name. We were torn between 'PathPilotAI' and 'CAREERPATH', so we chose the team name 'PathPilotAI' and the project name 'CAREERPATH', taking another step towards branding.
    - We hadn't decided on a color palette and hadn't yet finalized the logo.
    - Tuba İlhan Horuz created the logo and slogan.
    - Melih Talha Aktaş installed WordPress and selected the theme.
    - It was decided that the data to be used about professions would be collected from the O*NET website.
    - We researched existing personality tests.

Overall, we believe we had a good sprint process. The sprint process was as planned. Because our team was formed later, we held daily Google Meet meetings to complete all our planning within a week. We actively communicated through our WhatsApp group. We created a WhatsApp community for the group to back up documents and work files.


  - **Sprint Review Participants:** `Tuba İlhan Horuz`, `Duygu Başak Acar`, `Sude Nur Kömür`, `Melih Talha Bektaş`, `Saim Berk Akçeşme`
